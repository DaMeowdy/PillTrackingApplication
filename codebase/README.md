# Codebase
all of the application code including our front-end, DAL api and Database will be here

## STACK
### Front end :
- Typescript
- React native 
- Tailwind CSS
- Querying using React query
- Need to store data both on client device and on server, will need to timestamp data and make sure that client and server are synced.
#### IMPORTANT : Prototype frontend with vite using react with typescript
### Backend API :
- Rust
- ActixWeb for our DAL api
- tokio because we need an async runtime
- SeaORM
- rust style documentation
#### Make it interchangeable with Firebase
users being able to dump firebase creds in and it work on firebase would be awesome 
### Database : 
- Relational
- postgres
